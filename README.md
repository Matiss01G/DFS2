# Distributed File System (DFS)

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a Distributed File System (DFS) in C++, designed as a learning exercise to explore and gain hands-on experience with:

- **Networking**: Implementation of peer-to-peer communication using TCP/IP
- **Multithreading**: Managing concurrent operations and thread synchronization
- **Pipelining**: Stream processing and data transformation
- **Modern C++**: Practical application of C++ programming concepts
- **Security**: Basic implementation of encrypted file transfer using AES-256

While this implementation includes essential features like encrypted file transfer and peer-to-peer sharing, it's important to note that this is an educational project rather than a production-ready system. The focus was on learning and understanding the underlying concepts rather than creating a fully optimized DFS. 

## Prerequisites

Before building the DFS, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### System Requirements

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) or macOS
- At least 1GB of free disk space
- Minimum 2GB RAM
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

### Required Software Versions

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 13.2.0 or higher)
- CMake 3.29.2 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/dfs.git
cd dfs

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libgtest-dev

# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Start first peer node
./dfs_main -h 127.0.0.1 -p 3001

# In a new terminal, start second peer node
./dfs_main -h 127.0.0.1 -p 3002

# Connect peers (in either terminal's DFS shell)
DFS_Shell> connect 127.0.0.1:3002

# Use the DFS
```

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized file sharing between multiple nodes
- **Secure File Transfer**: AES-256-CBC encryption for all file transfers
- **Automatic File Synchronization**: Stored files automatically propagate across connected peers
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: SHA-256 based content addressing for efficient storage
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for system interaction

## Architecture Overview

The DFS consists of several key components:

- **FileServer**: Core component handling file operations and peer-to-peer sharing
- **CryptoStream**: Provides AES-256-CBC encryption for secure file transfers
- **Store**: Manages content-addressable storage using SHA-256 hashing
- **TCP_Peer**: Handles the exchange of data between 2 connected peers
- **PeerManager**: Handles peer connections
- **Channel**: Provides message queuing for communication between codec and FileServer
- **TCP_Server**: Manages network connections and peer handshaking
- **Bootstrap**: Coordinates initialization and lifecycle of DFS nodes for testing purposes

## Installing Dependencies

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# Install build essentials
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install pkg-config cmake libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libgtest-dev

```

### macOS (using Homebrew)

```

## Building the Project

1. Create and enter build directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

```

1. Generate build files:

```bash
cmake ..

```

1. Build the project:

```bash
make

```

## Running the DFS

### Starting a Peer Node

The DFS requires AT LEAST 2 participating peers to form a network. Each peer must be started with unique port numbers. 

This DFS is only tested to function locally, thus each peer must be created with an IP address of 127.0.0.1

```bash
./dfs_main [OPTIONS]

Options:
-h, --host <IP>        Local IP address (required)
-p, --port <number>    Port number to listen on (required)

```

Example: Starting two peers in different terminal windows:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Peer 1
./dfs_main -h 127.0.0.1 -p 3001

# Terminal 2 - Peer 2
./dfs_main -h 127.0.0.1 -p 3002

```

### Connecting Peers

After starting multiple peers, establish connections between them using the CLI:

```bash
DFS_Shell> connect 127.0.0.1:3002

```

## CLI Commands

The DFS provides a command-line interface with the following commands:

```
help              Display help message
pwd               Print current working directory
ls                List files in current directory
cd <dir>          Change to directory <dir>
read <file>       Read contents of <file>
store <file>      Store local <file> in DFS
delete <file>     Delete <file> from DFS
connect <ip:port> Connect to DFS server at <ip:port>
quit              Exit the DFS shell

```

## Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test suites that can be run individually or together:

```bash
# Run individual test suites
./codec_tests
./bootstrap_tests
./channel_tests
./store_tests
./crypto_tests

# Run all tests
./all_tests

```
